    "## Chapter 1: BigData & Artificial Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 1 provides an overview of some of the hot trends in the industry around Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. We will see how the world is being trans- formed through digitization, leading to the Big Data phenomenon—both in the consumer and industrial spaces. We see data volumes increasing exponen- tially, from terabytes to exabytes to zettabytes. We see the processing power of computers increase in magnitudes of tens and hundreds. We will talk about software getting smarter with the application of Artificial Intelligence—whether it’s IBM’s Watson beating human champions at Jeopardy! or Facebook automat- ically tagging friends in your photos, or even Google’s self-driving car. Finally, the chapter discusses the types of analytics and covers a simple example of building a system driven by analytics to deliver outcomes."
