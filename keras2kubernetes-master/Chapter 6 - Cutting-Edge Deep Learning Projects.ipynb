    "## Chapter 6: Cutting-Edge Deep Learning Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning is revolutionizing our world with some amazing results by processing images, text, speech, and video. It is extracting knowledge and insights from unstructured data. We saw examples of processing images and text data using Deep Learning in Chapter 5. In this chapter, we take that understanding to the next level and look at some interesting projects. These are innovative solutions folks have developed and shared with the community. These solu- tions have become very popular due to their unique nature, and you may have read a few news articles on these promoting AI. We will see cool projects like repainting photos in styles of famous painters and generating fake images that look indistinguishable from the real ones. We will see an example of detecting fraud in credit card transactions using unsupervised Deep Learning. Although the outcomes here are unique, the underlying Deep Learning techniques and concepts remain the same. As long as you have followed the concepts in the previous chapters, you should understand these well. Maybe reading about these projects will trigger an innovative spark in your mind and you will come up with the next big AI solution. Hereâ€™s hoping for that!\n",
